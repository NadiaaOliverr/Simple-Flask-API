# Simple Flask API
A simple flask api with get, post, put, and delete methods. A database isn't used. I Suggest you check the data of the requests in postman or insomnia.

## Requirements
- Python3
- Flask

## Get Started

Type this command at the terminal in the root folder:

```bash
user@user:~$ venv/bin/python3 app.py
```
